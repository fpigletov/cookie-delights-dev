                        <span>This is for all of my salted caramel lovers. I am such a HUGE fan of all things caramel.  I have been wanting to create a caramel cookie for so long. I decided to get to work in my kitchen with a brand new jar of salted caramel that I couldn't wait to put to use.</span>
                        <span>I was so excited to discover that this sea salt caramel cookie turned out absolutely perfectly! It was sweet, salty, chewy, with golden crispy edges. The perfect salted caramel cookie recipe!</span>
                        <span>The key to making a chewy caramel cookie is to start off with butter and a mix of dark brown sugar and white granulated sugar. Each of them plays an important role in these cookies. It helps to create a chewy center and crispy, buttery edges.</span>

                        <span>The siren call of melty milk chocolate and toasted marshmallows sandwiched between two graham crackers is one that resonates with me as an echo of many childhood camping trips.</span>
                        <span>I spent lots of summer nights around a campfire learning to toast the perfect marshmallow and deciding on my perfect ratio of marshmallow to chocolate to graham cracker. It’s 2 marshmallows to 4 squares of chocolate to 2 graham cracker halves, btw. I like plenty of marshmallow in the mix.</span>

                        <span>Perfect for chocolate lovers, this Double Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe is soft, chewy, and delightfully fudgy. They’re so irresistibly decadent and full of chocolatey flavor that you will not be able to stop at eating just one. Even better, they come together quickly as they don’t require any chill time.</span>
                        <span>If you’re a chocolate lover or fan of thick chunky cookies, then this chocolate cookie recipe is for you! It’s packed to the brim with chocolate flavor without tasting overly sweet! I’m obsessed with how these double chocolate chip cookies’ edges are crunchy while still being pillowy soft, and fudgy in the center. These cookies are always such a treat and will not fail to satisfy your chocolate cravings.</span>
                        <span>Since these double chocolate chip cookies are thick, they’re quite hearty and go really well with a tall glass of milk. And the best part is, they bake in 10 minutes so that you can whip them up in next to no time. Make a batch of these cookies to share or enjoy them all by yourself! You can also try my other cookie recipes like my classic Chocolate Chip Cookies or Cookies and Cream Cookies.</span>
